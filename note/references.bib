abstract = {Space heating in buildings is becoming a key element of sector-coupled energy system research. Data availability limits efforts to model the buildings sector, because heat consumption is not directly metered in most countries. Space heating is often related to weather through the proxy of heating degree-days using a specific heating threshold temperature, but methods vary between studies. This study estimates country-specific heating threshold temperatures using widely and publicly available consumption and weather data. This allows for national climate and culture-specific human behaviour to be captured in energy systems modelling. National electricity and gas consumption data are related to degree-days through linear models, and Akaike’s Information Criteria is used to define the summer season in each country, when space heating is not required. We find that the heating threshold temperatures computed using daily, weekly and monthly aggregated consumption data are statistically indifferent. In general, threshold temperatures for gas heating centre around 15.0  ±  1.7 ∘C (daily averaged temperature), while heating by electricity averages to 13.4  ±  2.4 ∘C. We find no evidence of space heating during June, July and August, even if heating degree-days are present.}

The JRC-EU-TIMES model is designed for analysing the role of energy technologies and their innovation for meeting Europe's energy and climate change related policy objectives. It models technologies uptake and deployment and their interaction with the energy infrastructure including storage options in an energy systems perspective. It is a relevant tool to support impact assessment studies in the energy policy field that require quantitative modelling at an energy system level with a high technology detail. This report aims at providing an overview on the JRC-EU-TIMES model main data inputs and major assumptions. Furthermore, it describes a number of model outputs from exemplary runs in order to display how the model reacts to different scenarios. The scenarios described in this report do not represent a quantified view of the European Commission on the future EU energy mix.

abstract={A new Swiss TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL--EFOM System) electricity model with an hourly representation of inter-temporal detail and a century-long model horizon has been developed to explore the TIMES framework's suitability as a long-term electricity dispatch model. To understand the incremental insights from this hourly model, it is compared to an aggregated model with only two diurnal timeslices like in most MARKAL/TIMES models. Two scenarios have been analysed with both models to answer the following questions: Are there differences in model solutions? What are the benefits of having a high number of timeslices? Are there any computational limitations? The primary objective of this paper is to understand the differences between the solutions of the two models, rather than Swiss policy implication or potential uncertainties in input parameters and assumptions. The analysis reveals that the hourly model offers powerful insights into the electricity generation schedule. Nevertheless, the TIMES framework cannot substitute for a dispatch model because some features cannot be represented; however, the long model time horizon and integrated system approaches of TIMES provide features not available in conventional dispatch models. The methodology of the model development and insights from the model comparison are described.},
