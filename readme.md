[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2023.113856](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2023.113856) . 

Extended documentation (cf. sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 in Appendix A of the article) in LaTeX format can be found in the directory 'note'.

Final annual gas demand estimates from the different models under the different weather scenarios are given in 'output'. 

Please download the raw temperature data and generate the intermediate outputs with the notebooks in 'preprocessing' before running the models.
