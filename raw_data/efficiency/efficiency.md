Energy efficiency improvements in space heating occurred as a result of the better thermal performance of new buildings encouraged by mandatory efficiency standards, an increase in condensing boilers and heat pumps, and thermal retrofitting of existing dwellings. Standards for new buildings contributed to reducing the average unit consumption of the dwelling stock for the EU as a whole by 0.7 %/year on average between 1990 and 2016, which represents about 2/3 of the total savings for household space heating (Figure 4).

Space heating energy consumption decreased at an average rate of 0.8 %/year between 2005 and 2016, whereas it was increasing slightly before that (+0.3 %/year from 1990 to 2005[4]). As a result, in 2016, space heating consumption was only 4 % below its 1990 level. The total floor area of dwellings has increased by 1.3 %/year, much more than the number of dwelling (+0.9 %/year). As a result, the space heating consumption per m2 has decreased more rapidly than space heating consumption per dwelling (respectively by 1.2 %/year and 1 %/year since 1990) reaching 118 kWh/m2 in 2016[5] (Figure 3); the difference is due to a slight increase in the average size of dwellings (+0.2 %/year). Significant disparities exist among EU countries, from less than 80 kWh/m2 in southern countries with lower heating needs (Spain, Bulgaria, Greece, Malta and Portugal) to more than 160 kWh/m2 in colder countries such as Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Luxemburg, Poland and Czechia[6].

Heating is by far the largest end-use for households (64% in 2018). The heating consumption of households per m2 has been decreasing by 1.7%/year thanks to the tightening of building codes, coupled with financial incentives to promote thermal retrofitting of existing dwellings and the adoption of more efficient heating systems. The energy consumption per dwelling decreased less than the consumption per m2 (by 0.9%/year and 1.3%/year respectively) because of an increase in the average dwelling size (+0.4%/year since 2000). The shares of cooking and water heating are decreasing while electrical appliances account for a higher share; the share of air conditioning (AC) is still marginal.
